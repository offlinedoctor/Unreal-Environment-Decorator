# Unreal-Editor-Tools

Inspired by a lecture given by an Unreal Engine Evangelist, I became very interested in developing a set of Editor Tools that could be used to make the 'tedious' aspects of Game Development (eg. Environment Placement), fun and interesting.

This is a 'backbone' on how a system could be setup to create more sophisticated Editor Tools, enjoy!

# How to use
1. Download this Repo

2. Place into an Unreal Engine Project (preferably C++)

3. Rebuild Project if needed.

4. In Contents Folder go to the plugin named "EditorUtilityPlugin".

5. Right Click and Run Editor Utility Widget.

6. On the RHS is a drop down box, select the object you want to use to decorate the environment.

7. Hit the "Spawn Selected Furniture", and it will allow you to place that object in the world.

Please see the video below on a Quick Start Summary:
